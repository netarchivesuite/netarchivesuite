<!--

	This file contains a WaybackCollection implementation using a manually
	created and administered CDX index file(s).
	
	The format of the path-index.txt is
		<NAME><TAB><PATH-OR-URL>

	Be sure to set the environment variable LC_ALL to "C" before sorting CDX
	files and path-index.txt files.

	All paths in this file reference the Spring property placeholder 
	"wayback.basedir" defined in wayback.xml. That value may be changed to
	alter top-level prefixes for these paths, or the values in this file can
	be changed directly for further flexibility.
